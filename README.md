# SimpsonsTriviaGame
My first attempt at taking a card based trivia game and turning it into a computer game with a database.
For checking answers you have to type in on if they correct or not I created a class to check how close what you typed is to what the
answer is and give it a percentage, 66% or higher will count it as correct. (i.e. caf is 66% close to cat and would be correct).
